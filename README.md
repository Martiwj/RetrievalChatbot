# Retrieval Chatbot

This is an easy-to-use retrieval chatbot where its replies are based on the dataset you choose to prompt it with. Currently, it's a Marvel-based chatbot that utilizes dialogues from all 23 MCU movies.

## How to Use

Simply clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Martiwj/RetrievalChatbot.git`. Then run the `ChatCLI.py` for a CLI interface or `ChatGUI.py` for a GUI interface, and you should be good to go.

If you want to use a different dataset than Marvel, you can easily do so by implementing changes to the path in `ChatGui.py` to point to the desired dataset. For the bot to perform optimally, I recommend using a dialogue-based dataset.

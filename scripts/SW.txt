Snoke trained you well.
I killed Snoke.
I'll kill you.

I made Snoke.
I have been every voice...

(AS DARTH VADER)

I will give you so much more.
You'll die first.

I have died before.
The dark side of the Force

unnatural.

What could you give me?
Everything.
A new Empire.

I didn't finish

I'm making excuses.
Don't tell me

Tell me what they are.
I think I'm just tired.
That's all.
CONNIX: General...
the <i>Falcon</i>

POE: It's on fire!
(BB-8 WHINES)
Whole thing's on fire.
All of it.
-It's on fire.
-REY: Hey.
-Hey!
-There's a spy?
Really could have used
your help out there.
How'd it go?
Really bad, actually.
Really bad.
-Han's ship...
-What'd you do to the droid?
What'd you do to the <i>Falcon?</i>
The <i>Falcon's</i> in
a lot better shape than he is.
BB-8's not on fire.
What's left of him
isn't on fire.
-Tell me what happened.
-You tell me first.
-You know what you are?

You're difficult.
Really difficult.

Yeah. Barely.

Do we have a spy?
-Well...
-(CHEWBACCA GRUNTS)
You light speed skipped?
POE: Yeah, well, it got us
back here, didn't it?
Poe, the compressor's down.
-Oh, I know, I was there.
-Every time.
You can't light speed skip
the <i>Falcon!</i>
Actually,
it turns out you can.
All right, guys,
we just landed, okay?
What happened?
Bad news,
that's what happened.
No spy?
No.
Spy.
Did we make contact
with a spy or not?
There's a mole
in the First Order,
and they sent us a message.
You dropped a tree on him?
You blew
both sub-alternators?
POE: Well, you know what...
maybe you should've been
out there with us!
You know
I wanna be out there with you.
Yeah, but you're not.
You're here training.
For what?
You're the best fighter
we have.
We need you.
Out there, not here.
Junior...
get Artoo into reconditioning.
FINN: It's true.
What's the message?
POE: We've decoded the intel
from the First Order spy...
and it confirms the worst.
(SIGHS) Somehow,
Palpatine returned.
(ALL GASP, MURMURING)
Wait. Do we believe this?
AFTAB: It cannot be.
The Emperor is dead.
Dark science.
Cloning.
Secrets only the Sith knew.
POE: He's been planning
his revenge.
His followers have been
building something for years.
The largest fleet
the galaxy has ever known.
He calls it the Final Order.
In 16 hours, attacks
on all free worlds begin.
(CHEWBACCA GROANS)
The Emperor and his fleet
have been hiding
in the Unknown Regions.
On a world called Exegol.
(R2-D2 CHIRPS FRANTICALLY)
C-3PO: Exegol does not appear
on any star chart.
But legend describes it as
the hidden world of the Sith.
BEAUMONT:
There were always whispers
of his hunger to cheat death.
So, Palpatine's been out there
all this time.
Pulling the strings.
Always. In the shadows.
From the very beginning.
MAZ: If we want to stop him,
we must find him.
Must find Exegol.
REY: General?
Can I speak with you?
I know how to get to Exegol.
-Tell me.
-Luke searched for it.
For a long time.
He nearly found it.
There are ciphers here
I can't read.
But he said to get there,
you need one of these.
A Sith wayfinder.
They're compasses
that lead the way to Exegol.
To stop
what we both know is coming...
I need to finish
what Luke started.
Find Exegol.
Find the Emperor.
No.
I don't want to go without
your blessing, but I will.
I will.
It's what you would do.
POE: So, you got her
up and running?
REY: You were right before.
I'm gonna pick up
Luke's search for Exegol.
I'm gonna start
where his trail went cold.
The Forbidden Desert
of Pasaana.
Yeah, I know.
We're going with you.
Chewie, you get
that compressor fixed?
-(CHEWBACCA GRUNTS)
-I need to go alone.
Yeah. Alone with friends.
It's too dangerous, Finn.
We go together.
(GRUNTS)
(BB-8 CHIRPING)
C-3PO: I wholeheartedly agree.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
FINN: Rose, last chance.
The General asked me to study
the specs of old Destroyers.
So we can stop the fleet
if you find it.
"If"?
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) When.
When.
Hey, we should get going.
What is it?
Nothing.
C-3PO: In the event
that I do not return...
I want you to know
that you have been
a real friend, Artoo.
My best one, in fact.
(R2-D2 CHIRPING HAPPILY)
There's so much
I want to tell you.
Tell me when you get back.

They've conjured

-A Sith wayfinder.
-(BB-8 CHIRPS)
Luke Skywalker came here
to find one.
(CHUCKLES) I know.
I was with him.
Luke and I were tailing
an old Jedi hunter.
Ochi of Bestoon.
He was carrying a clue
that could lead
to a wayfinder.
We followed his ship halfway
across the galaxy here.
When we got to his ship,
it was abandoned...
No clue.
No wayfinder.
Is Ochi's ship still here?
It's out in the desert,
where he left it.
We need to get to that ship.
Search it again.
(ENGINES WHIRRING IN DISTANCE)
I got a bad feeling

Ochi's ship
is out past Lurch Canyon.
-Go.
-Thank you, General.

Yeah. Mm-hmm.
We're gonna die

This was Ochi's?
Luke sensed it.
Ochi never left this place.
FINN: And he ended up
down here.

for his ship.
Same thing happened to us,
happened to him.
FINN: So, how did
Ochi get out?
He didn't.
(CHEWBACCA GROANS)

have happened with this.
POE: There's writing on it.
C-3PO:
Perhaps I can translate.
Oh. The location
of the wayfinder,
has been inscribed
upon this dagger.
It's the clue that Master Luke
was looking for.
-And?
-Where's the wayfinder?
C-3PO: I am afraid
I cannot tell you.
20.3 fazillion languages,
you can't read that?
C-3PO:
Oh, I have read it, sir.
I know exactly
where the wayfinder is.
Unfortunately, it is written
in the runic language
of the Sith.
So what?
C-3PO: My programming forbids
me from translating it.
So, you're telling us
the one time
we need you to talk,
you can't?
C-3PO: Irony, sir.
I am mechanically incapable
of speaking translations
from Sith.
I believe the rule was passed

Well, then we gotta find
another way.
Well, there isn't.

C-3PO: So true.
The inscription lives
only in my memory now.
Hold on.
The inscription that was on
the dagger is in your memory?
C-3PO: Yes, Master Poe.
But the translation
from a forbidden language
cannot be retrieved.
That is short of a complete

<i>You, up against the wall.</i>
<i>Show me your identification.</i>
<i>Where is your identification?</i>
-POE: They're everywhere.
-(WOMAN SHOUTS)
Please, leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.
POE: All right,
I know what we should do.
C-3PO: So do I.
We should leave.
Clam it, Threepio.
Follow me.
All right.
Let's head down this way.
WOMAN: <i>Heard you were
spotted at Monk's Gate.</i>
<i>Thought, "He's not stupid
enough to come back here."</i>
Oh, you'd be surprised.
-Who's this?
-What's going on?
Guys, this is Zorii.
Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.
ZORII: <i>I could pull
this trigger right now.</i>
-I've seen you do worse.
-ZORII: <i>For a lot less.</i>
Can we just, uh...
talk about this?
ZORII: <i>I wanna see your brains
in the snow.</i>
So, you're still mad?
Zorii, we could use your help.
We gotta crack this droid's
head open and fast.
C-3PO: Pardon me!
We're trying to find
Babu Frik.
ZORII: <i>Babu? Babu only works
with the crew.</i>
<i>That's not you anymore.</i>
REY: What crew?
ZORII: <i>Oh, funny
he never mentioned it.</i>
<i>Your friend's old job
was running spice.</i>
You were a spice runner?
-You were a stormtrooper?
-Were you a spice runner?
Were you a scavenger?
We could do this all night.
ZORII: <i>You don't have
all night.</i>
<i>You know, I'm still digging
out of the hole you put me in</i>
<i>when you left
to join the Resistance.</i>
<i>You.</i>
<i>You're the one
they're looking for.</i>
<i>Bounty for her
just might cover us.</i>
-<i>Djak'kankah!</i>
-Don't <i>djak'kankah.</i>
(ALL GRUNTING)

We could really use your help.

I must be malfunctioning.
Babu Frik?
Can you help us with this?
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)
Zorii?
Is this gonna work?
(ZORII AND BABU FRIK

ZORII: <i>He says

<i>Words, translated from Sith.</i>
-That's it.
-Yeah, that's what we need.
ZORII: <i>Who are you hanging out
with that speaks Sith?</i>
Can you make him...
Babu, can you make him
translate it?
(ZORII AND BABU FRIK
CONVERSING IN ALIEN LANGUAGE)
ZORII: <i>Yes. But it will
cause a complete...</i>
C-3PO: A complete memory wipe.
Wait, wait, wait.
We make him translate it...
he won't remember... anything?
(IN ENGLISH)
Droid, memory go blank.
-C-3PO: Oh!
-Blank, blank.
C-3PO: There must be
some other way.
Doesn't Artoo back up
your memory?
C-3PO: Oh, please.
Artoo's storage units
are famously unreliable.
You know the odds
better than any of us.
Do we have a choice?
C-3PO:
If this mission fails...
it was all for nothing.
All we've done...
all this time.
What are you doing there,
Threepio?
Taking one last look, sir...
at my friends.
DROID: Sad.
(MUFFLED THUDDING)
Uh-oh.
ZORII: <i>Night raids
are gonna start soon.</i>
-<i>I'll keep lookout.</i>
-I'm coming with you.
ZORII: (SCOFFS)
<i>You still don't trust me, huh?</i>
POE: Did you ever trust me?
ZORII: <i>Nope.</i>
(LAUGHS)
KYLO REN: <i>Report,

There's been
a development, sir.
The Knights of Ren
have tracked the scavenger.
To a settlement called Kijimi.
Shall we destroy the city,

ZORII: <i>First Order took most

<i>Can't stand the cries anymore.</i>
<i>I've saved up enough
to get out.</i>
<i>I'm going to the Colonies.</i>
How? All those hyperlanes
are blocked.
That's a First Order Captain's

I've never seen a real one.
ZORII: <i>Free passage

<i>Landing privileges,

(HELMET WHIRS)
<i>Wanna come with me?</i>
(POE SIGHS)
I can't walk out on this war.
Not till it's over.
Maybe it is.
We sent out a call for help
at the Battle of Crait.
Nobody came.
Everyone's so afraid.
They've given up.
ZORII: <i>No, I don't believe
you believe that.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>
<i>They win by making you think
you're alone.</i>
<i>Remember?</i>
<i>There's more of us.</i>
DROID: Squeaky wheel.
I have a squeaky wheel.
Squeak eliminated.
Thank you.
Very kind.
REY: Something's not right
about all of this.
FINN: Hmm?
I know where I've seen it.
The ship he was on.
Ochi's ship.
What?
The day my parents left.
They were on that ship.
-Are you sure?

He's on Ren's ship.
He's alive.

Chewie's this way.

<i>You don't know

<i>It was Palpatine

What were you gonna
tell Rey before?
You still on that?
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?
(CHEWBACCA GROANING)
Yeah.
Sort of is a bad time, Poe.
Well, 'cause later doesn't
really look like an option.
If you're gonna let

No! Ahh!
-(GROANS)
-Why are you helping us?
I don't care if you win.
I need Kylo Ren to lose.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Why did the Emperor
come for me?
Why did he want to kill
a child?
Tell me.
KYLO REN: <i>Because he saw
what you would become.</i>
<i>You don't just have power.</i>
<i>You have his power.</i>
<i>You're his granddaughter.</i>
<i>You are a Palpatine.</i>
(GASPING SOFTLY)

I see.
Get me the Supreme Leader.

All that matters is

you were the last hope.
We have to get to that wreck.
There is something

I can take you there by water.
-Have you seen the water?
-WOMAN: Not now.
Too dangerous.
We can go
first light tomorrow.
We can't wait that long.
We don't have the time.
Or the choice.
Let's get that ship fixed.
Do you have any spare parts?

JANNAH: It's an O-6,

Thank you.
This is a First Order part.
There's an old cruiser
on the west ridge.
Stripped for parts.
The one we were assigned to.
The one we escaped in.
Okay, wait.
You were First Order?
Not by choice.
We were conscripted as kids.
All of us.
I was TZ-1719. Stormtrooper.
FN-2187.
You?
I never knew there were more.
Deserters? All of us here
were stormtroopers.
We mutinied at the battle
of Ansett Island.
They told us
to fire on civilians.
We wouldn't do it.
We laid our weapons down.
-All of you?
-The whole company.
(CHUCKLES)
I don't even know
how it happened.
It wasn't a decision, really,
it was like...
An instinct.
Feeling.
A feeling.
The Force.
The Force brought me here.
It brought me to Rey.
And Poe.
You say that
like you're sure it's real.
It's real.
I wasn't sure then...
but I am now.

we're gonna lose her.

I was wrong.
It was fear that kept me here.

Myself.
Because you're a Palpatine.
Leia knew it, too.
She didn't tell me.
She still trained me.
Because she saw your spirit.
Your heart.

Some things are stronger

Confronting fear

<i>at the end of her Jedi path.</i>
<i>She surrendered her saber
to me and said that one day...</i>
it would be picked up again...
by someone who would
finish her journey.
A thousand generations
live in you now.
But this is your fight.
You'll take both sabers
to Exegol.
I can't get there.
I don't have the wayfinder.
I destroyed Ren's ship.
You have everything you need.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
REY: Two were made.
(RUMBLING)
(R2-D2 CHIRPING)
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.
-And you are?
-(R2-D2 CHIRPS)
-What?
-(R2-D2 CHIRPS)
Well, I am quite certain
I would remember
if I had a best friend.
(R2-D2 CHIRPING)
You want to put what
in my head?
Under no circumstances...
(WHIRRING)
(IN ROBOTIC VOICE)
Memory restoration complete.
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Artoo, have you heard?
I am going with Mistress Rey
on her very first mission.
(R2-D2 CHIRPING)
-I already have?
-(R2-D2 CHIRPING)
Picking up a signal?
From whom?
All the information you need
for an air strike on Exegol.
Yeah, except how to get there.
Are you seeing
these atmo readings?
It's a mess out there.
Magnetic crossfields.
Gravity wells, solar winds.
How does a fleet
even take off from there?
C-3PO: Terribly sorry.
I'm afraid Artoo's memory bank
must be crossed
with his logic receptors.
He says he is receiving
a transmission from
Master Luke.
That's an old craft ID.
That's Luke Skywalker's
X-wing.
C-3PO: It's transmitting
course marker signals
on its way
to the Unknown Regions.
It's Rey.
(BB-8 CHIRPING)
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
FINN: <i>She's going to Exegol.</i>
She's showing us.
She's showing us
how to get there.
Then we go together.
(INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT
ON PA)
Come on, buddy, we need you.
FINN: <i>As long as those
Star Destroyers are on Exegol</i>
we can hit them.
BEAUMONT: Hit them how?
ROSE: They can't activate
their shields
until they leave atmosphere.
Which isn't easy on Exegol.
Ships that size
need help taking off.
Nav can't tell
which way's up out there.
So, how do the ships take off?
They use a signal
from a navigation tower,
like this one.
Except they won't.
Air team's gonna
find the tower,
ground team's gonna blast it.
-Ground team?
-I have an idea for that.
Once the tower's down, the
fleet will be stuck in atmo...
for just minutes,
with no shields,
and no way out.
We think hitting the cannons
might ignite
the main reactors.
That's our chance.
We need to pull
some Holdo manoeuvres.
Do some real damage.
FINN: Come on.
That move is one in a million.
Fighters and freighters
can take out their cannons
if there are enough of us.
(SPEAKS ALIEN LANGUAGE)
There aren't enough of us!
He's right. We'd be
no more than bugs to them.
That's where Lando and Chewie
come in.
They'll take the <i>Falcon</i>
to the Core Systems.
Send out a call for help
for anybody listening.
We've got friends out there.
They'll come if they know
there's hope.
(ALL MURMURING)
POE: They will.
First Order wins by making us
think we're alone.
We're not alone.
Good people will fight
if we lead them.
FINN: <i>Leia never gave up.</i>
<i>And neither will we.</i>
<i>We're gonna show them
we're not afraid.</i>
POE: <i>What our mothers
and fathers fought for...</i>
<i>we will not let die.</i>
<i>Not today.</i>
<i>Today, we make our last stand.</i>
<i>For the galaxy.</i>
<i>For Leia.</i>
For everyone we've lost.
They've taken enough of us.
Now we take the war to them.

TECHNICIAN:
<i>Clear run frequency.</i>
SOLDIER: <i>Captain, we have
Resistance craft incoming.</i>
Allegiant General...
<i>Use ion cannons!</i>
Look at that fleet.
Damn it!
Welcome to Exegol.
Watch your starboard, Wexley!
-Whoa!
-Get to their altitude.
They can't fire on us
without hitting each other.
Don't give up.
Help is coming.
FINN: There it is.
Poe, I see it.
I've got a visual
on the tower.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(LASERS FIRING)
-Incoming TIEs!
-I see 'em!
I got you, Finn.
-You ready back there?
-Never been readier.
They're targeting
the navigation tower...
so the fleet can't deploy.
PRYDE: Then we won't use
that tower.
Switch over the source
of navigation signal
to this ship.
We'll guide
the fleet out ourselves.
The navigation tower
has been deactivated.
-What?
-Those ships need that signal.
It's gotta be coming
from somewhere.
POE: <i>They figured out
what we're doing.</i>
<i>Call off the ground invasion.</i>
FINN: Wait.
The nav signal's coming
from that command ship.
That's our drop zone.
How do you know?
A feeling.
You wanna launch
a ground invasion
on a Star Destroyer?
I don't want to,
but we can't take out
that ship's nav system
from the air.
Give us cover.
We gotta keep that fleet there
till help arrives.
-We hope.
-We hope.
POE: You heard the General.
All Wings, cover that lander.
They've landed
a troop carrier.
-Jam the speeders.
-I can't, sir.
Why not?
They're not using speeders.
FINN: Not bad for one lesson.
You had a good teacher!
Keep going!
(BB-8 CHIRPING)
You're doing great, buddy!
The tower's up ahead.

Empress Palpatine.
You will take the throne.

It is your birthright
to rule here.
It is in your blood.
Our blood.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
I haven't come
to lead the Sith...
I have come to end them.
As a Jedi?
-Yes.
-PALPATINE: No.
Your hatred, your anger.
You want to kill me.
That is what I want.
Kill me...
and my spirit
will pass into you.
As all the Sith live in me...
you will be Empress...
we will be one.
Those thrusters are hot.
How are we doing?
We're gonna blow our way in,
and take out that nav tower.
All the hatches
are blast-proof!

Nice one, Finn.
Nav signal's down,
but not for long.
We're offline, sir.
Reset the navigation signal!
Minutes away, sir.
-Finn, let's go!
-No, no, wait, listen.
The crown cannons
have stopped.
They're resetting
their systems.
-So?
-I gotta go do something.
I'm staying with you.
Still no <i>Falcon</i> or backup.
(R2-D2 CHIRPS)
I don't know, Artoo.
Maybe nobody else is coming.
What do we do, General?
We gotta hit them ourselves.
What can we do
against these things?
POE: <i>Just stay alive!</i>
The time has come!
(GASPING)
With your hatred,
you will take my life.
And you will ascend.
All you want is for me
to hate, but I won't.
Not even you.
Weak.
Like your parents.
My parents were strong.
They saved me from you.
Your Master, Luke Skywalker,
was saved by his father.
The only family
you have here...
is me.
(RUMBLING)
-They don't have long.
-(REY SHUDDERING)
<i>No one is coming to help them.</i>
<i>And you are the one

<i>Strike me down.

<i>Only you have the power
lo save therm.</i>
<i>Refuse, and your new family...</i>
dies.
Good.
(GRUNTS)
Ow.
Finn, where are you?
The lander's leaving.
-<i>Finn!</i>
-Go without us.
We're taking
this entire ship down.
What? How?
FINN: <i>We're gonna hit
the command deck.</i>
Rose, please.
Go.
-Rose!
-Rose!
